Let's learn from each others mistakes, talk about the histroy and find ways to move forward and be more effective. Are there things we can learn from? Is it worth to try it again or should we move on? Should we change the tactic to make this specific form more effective? Are there new things we should focus on? As you can see, there is a lot to talk about.

      "description":"Are invertebrates such as insects sentient, and if yes, what can we do to improve their welfare? This presentation discusses recent findings about insect neurobiology and consciousness and deals with general ethical issues of population ethics and wild animal suffering as well as specific issues in agriculture and food production (e.g. insect meat, bee colony collapse, insecticides). Invertebrate suffering is possibly the biggest kind of animal suffering that is most neglected by animal rights activists, and researching insect welfare biology may generate highly impactful opportunities to improve welfare on earth.<br/><br/><br/>Stijn Bruers has a PhD in physics and in moral philosophy, and a master in economics.

Often, too, vegans have trouble relating and communicating with other vegans when they disagree with each other\u2019s ideas. <br/><br/>In this presentation, psychologist Dr. Melanie Joy explains the principles and tools for creating healthy, connected relationships, and she gives tips on how to talk about even the most challenging issues productively.<br/><br/>Melanie Joy is an American social psychologist and author, primarily notable for promulgating the term carnism. She is the President of Beyond Carnism, previously known as Carnism Awareness &amp; Action Network (CAAN), a non-profit advocacy group which she founded in 2010, as well as the former professor of psychology and sociology at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
