      "description":"The question every activist confront themselves with is probably \"What am I even doing? Is it really helping the animals?\" Sometimes we fail, sometimes things we do can backfire. We have limited time and limeted resources in general. Let's learn from each others mistakes, talk about the histroy and find ways to move forward and be more effective. Are there things we can learn from? Is it worth to try it again or should we move on? Should we change the tactic to make this specific form more effective? Are there new things we should focus on? As you can see, there is a lot to talk about.

Love to see you there. <br/><br/>A word from Joyce about herself: 'I first encountered Nonviolent Communication in 2013 and this has opened my eyes. For me, this is the piece of connection I've been looking for all along. It soon became clear that I wanted to spread this connecting communication as a trainer. By applying the communication model in my daily life I have found more peace.'<br/><br/>This talk and open discussion will be take place in the online platform zoom.

      "description":"Are invertebrates such as insects sentient, and if yes, what can we do to improve their welfare? This presentation discusses recent findings about insect neurobiology and consciousness and deals with general ethical issues of population ethics and wild animal suffering as well as specific issues in agriculture and food production (e.g. insect meat, bee colony collapse, insecticides). Invertebrate suffering is possibly the biggest kind of animal suffering that is most neglected by animal rights activists, and researching insect welfare biology may generate highly impactful opportunities to improve welfare on earth.<br/><br/><br/>Stijn Bruers has a PhD in physics and in moral philosophy, and a master in economics. He is president of Effective Altruism Belgium, activist at animal rights organizations Bite Back, and author of several books about environmental and animal ethics.<br/><br/>Time: 19.00 (7PM) CEST (Paris/Berlin)<br/>Max 100 paticipants.<br/><br/>This talk and open discussion will be take place in the online platform zoom.

      "description":"Many vegans find that it\u2019s difficult or impossible to feel connected with the non-vegans in their lives and to communicate about veganism in a way that doesn\u2019t cause conflict. Often, too, vegans have trouble relating and communicating with other vegans when they disagree with each other\u2019s ideas. <br/><br/>In this presentation, psychologist Dr. Melanie Joy explains the principles and tools for creating healthy, connected relationships, and she gives tips on how to talk about even the most challenging issues productively.<br/><br/>Melanie Joy is an American social psychologist and author, primarily notable for promulgating the term carnism. She is the President of Beyond Carnism, previously known as Carnism Awareness &amp; Action Network (CAAN), a non-profit advocacy group which she founded in 2010, as well as the former professor of psychology and sociology at the University of Massachusetts Boston. She has published the books Strategic Action for Animals, Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows and Beyond Beliefs.<br/><br/>This talk and open discussion will be take place in the online platform zoom.

Our goal is to take the conversation away from Facebook comment threads and towards a live discussion in the hopes that we can better understand where everyone is coming from and move the discussion in a positive direction.<br/><br/>This session will focus on movement history as well as current perceptions.  We hope to arrange a session in the future to cover this issue in more depth with additional special guests, as it's unlikely we'll be able to do this fully in the first event on this topic.<br/><br/>\u27a4 EVENT FORMAT<br/>Participants will be able to share their thoughts through anonymous poll questions.  We will use these questions prompts and the results to help guide the conversation.<br/><br/>\u27a4 GUESTS<br/>We are thrilled to announce that we have at least one special guest joining us to help address this topic more fully!<br/><br/>DR COREY LEE WRENN is a vegan feminist sociologist of social movements, who specialises in anti-speciesist protest and human-nonhuman relations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Republic of Ireland.

        "description": "Call to Action!<br/><br/>Under Trump, ICE has become the American Gestapo, operating outside of local and international laws: imprisoning refugees in concentration camps, putting children in cages, hunting down our neighbors, and committing crimes against humanity.<br/><br/>ICE is a danger to our community, not just to those they target, to all of us. This is an organization that carries out raids and kidnappings in our \"sanctuary city\" with impunity, despite being embroiled in countless scandals. From abuse and sexual assaults on immigrants, to secret white nationalist facebook groups. From a culture of open cruelty and racism, to open neglect and even murder. Even their recent public shooting during an arrest in New York demonstrates just how reckless and dangerous they continue to be to the public at large.<br/><br/>In spite of this, our leaders continue to fail to protect our communities.<br/>In Washington County, the Sheriff just announced they would cooperate with ICE despite their a \"sanctuary\" status. In Multnomah County, ICE is deporting a Portland teacher and the mayor/police commissioner has been silent. Once again, it is on us, the people, to protect our community and defend our neighbors.<br/><br/>Again and again, we have seen injustice committed by our own government and have been unable to do anything about it, but this time, we can. <br/><br/>ICE is coming for one of our neighbors, someone who grew up in this community, in this city. Someone who worked hard to make something of himself so that he could give back to this community, as a teacher. His name is Hector, he is a 3rd grade teacher in the Montavilla neighborhood. He is also a father to a child that would remain in Portland. <br/><br/>Hector is a vital part of this community. Portland will fight for him like we mean it, because we do.<br/><br/>Our brother and comrade Hector faces deportation, we cannot and stay silent. <br/>We take this opportunity to demand ICE out of Oregon! <br/>We take this moment to demand an end to the deportations! <br/>We stand together to demand the abolition of ICE and the end of child and family separation! <br/><br/>Until the last cage is ripped open and the last child is set free, WE WILL FIGHT.<br/><br/>Join us!<br/><br/>This event is co-sponsored by Direct Action Alliance &amp; The Buddhist Peace Fellowship<br/>Organizations Standing in Solidarity:<br/>Portland Association of Teachers Racial and Social Justice Committees<br/>First Unitarian Church<br/>Teressa Raiford for Mayor 2020<br/>Portland Association of Teachers<br/>Bridger Equity Committee<br/>Jobs with Justice<br/>SURJ Black Lives Matter Action Group<br/>Innovation Law Lab<br/>Hampton Institute Working Class Think Tank<br/>World Arts Foundation, Inc.<br/><br/><br/>#keepHectorhome<br/> #AbolishICE<br/>#stopthedeportations<br/>#returnthechildren<br/>#endmassincarceration<br/><br/>ICE has become an extrajudicial organization that has been terrorizing immigrant communities across this country since it's creation, tearing families apart, disregarding local laws, and destroying public trust in vital institutions.
