      "description": "The question every activist confront themselves with is probably \"What am I even doing? Is it really helping the animals?\" Sometimes we fail, sometimes things we do can backfire. We have limited time and limeted resources in general. Let's learn from each others mistakes, talk about the histroy and find ways to move forward and be more effective. Are there things we can learn from? Is it worth to try it again or should we move on? Should we change the tactic to make this specific form more effective? Are there new things we should focus on? As you can see, there is a lot to talk about. Prepare yourself, do some research and lets talk about it!<br/><br/>Open discussion : Effective activism part 2<br/>https://www.facebook.com/events/1333616800164373/<br/><br/>This talk and open discussion will be take place in the online platform zoom.

      "description": "Are invertebrates such as insects sentient, and if yes, what can we do to improve their welfare? This presentation discusses recent findings about insect neurobiology and consciousness and deals with general ethical issues of population ethics and wild animal suffering as well as specific issues in agriculture and food production (e.g. insect meat, bee colony collapse, insecticides). Invertebrate suffering is possibly the biggest kind of animal suffering that is most neglected by animal rights activists, and researching insect welfare biology may generate highly impactful opportunities to improve welfare on earth.<br/><br/><br/>Stijn Bruers has a PhD in physics and in moral philosophy, and a master in economics. He is president of Effective Altruism Belgium, activist at animal rights organizations Bite Back, and author of several books about environmental and animal ethics.<br/><br/>Time: 19.00 (7PM) CEST (Paris/Berlin)<br/>Max 100 paticipants.<br/><br/>This talk and open discussion will be take place in the online platform zoom.

      "title": "How Vegans Can Improve Relationships and Communication by Dr. Melanie Joy",
      "description": "Many vegans find that it\u2019s difficult or impossible to feel connected with the non-vegans in their lives and to communicate about veganism in a way that doesn\u2019t cause conflict. Often, too, vegans have trouble relating and communicating with other vegans when they disagree with each other\u2019s ideas. <br/><br/>In this presentation, psychologist Dr. Melanie Joy explains the principles and tools for creating healthy, connected relationships, and she gives tips on how to talk about even the most challenging issues productively.<br/><br/>Melanie Joy is an American social psychologist and author, primarily notable for promulgating the term carnism. She is the President of Beyond Carnism, previously known as Carnism Awareness &amp; Action Network (CAAN), a non-profit advocacy group which she founded in 2010, as well as the former professor of psychology and sociology at the University of Massachusetts Boston. She has published the books Strategic Action for Animals, Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows and Beyond Beliefs.<br/><br/>This talk and open discussion will be take place in the online platform zoom.

We hope to arrange a session in the future to cover this issue in more depth with additional special guests, as it's unlikely we'll be able to do this fully in the first event on this topic.<br/><br/>\u27a4 EVENT FORMAT<br/>Participants will be able to share their thoughts through anonymous poll questions.  We will use these questions prompts and the results to help guide the conversation.<br/><br/>\u27a4 GUESTS<br/>We are thrilled to announce that we have at least one special guest joining us to help address this topic more fully!<br/><br/>DR COREY LEE WRENN is a vegan feminist sociologist of social movements, who specialises in anti-speciesist protest and human-nonhuman relations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Republic of Ireland.

The Orcas Species has the most convoluted Brain on the planet with more surface area for processing information then any other on the planet earth. It is because of this amazing brain that the Orca has more social connection and emotion capacity the even the human brain...so we can\u2019t even comprehend the level of pain and grief these beautiful mammals go through watching family member after family member slowly starve in front of their very eyes.<br/>There has only been 2 successful birth in almost 5 years for the Southern Resident Orca. These Orca have a 19 month gestational period and because they are starving to death they are losing these babies in the late term of pregnancy. There are very few breeding pair possibles left and if something doesn\u2019t change NOW extinction is inevitable. They are in such dire straits that we lost 9 of them in a one year period due to starvation. Now we are at 73 whales left....the lowest number in almost 50 years after the population of these families were decimated by a rush on Orca captivity for entertainment and Hundreds of family members from J, K and L pod were murdered or stolen from the Ocean. <br/>Scientists and Activists are in agreement that the only thing that will Save this beloved species from certain starvation is the breaching of the Lower 4 dams on the Snake River allowing the Salmon a habitat up river in which to spawn in cold clean water. <br/>To find out more about this process please<br/>Visit www.damsense.org<br/>This has been something that we have been fighting for, for years. Now in this desperate time we are hoping it will finally happen. <br/>I could go on &amp; on but if you are interested and want to know more please contact me. <br/>We are putting together a plan for some larger action to help the Orca and I will need all of you....but for now I am asking you to contact the Senators &amp; Governors in both Washington and Oregon as often as you can!!

These constant studies are just a stall tactic. Meanwhile the Salmon of the Pacific Northwest and the Southern Resident Killer Whales are going extinct. The time is NOW.... Ken Balcom from the Center for Whale Research says if we are lucky we have another have until the end of 2019 to get started breaching. In addition these dams aren\u2019t adding even adding power to the grid and are costing Tax payers millions. DON\u2019T let this happen on your clock do the right thing....let it be your legacy Breach the lower 4 dams on the Snake River NOW to save millions of tax dollars annually, bring wealth &amp; jobs to a region and restore salmon runs which will save the southern resident Orcas from going extinct.",

We will be walking from the Capitol stairs to the police department with the intent of bringing awareness to the importance of white people speaking out against the social injustices that have plagued the black community for far too long.<br/><br/>This work cannot take place in isolation from or disconnected from the powerful leadership of communities of color and we hope to welcome all like-minded individuals to march with us and demand that our local officials and police departments stand up on the behalf of the citizens they represent and fight for necessary changes within their respective institutions.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in helping organize this event or are a member of any community based groups that may have some insight as to how we can ensure that this gathering and gatherings to follow are as impactful and productive as possible, please reach out. This is a learning experience for us all and it's important that we all stay humble, teachable, and step up to the plate to leverage our white privilege to create change. It is our responsibility to stand up and advocate for the black community with hope of one day leading our country to a place within which we can begin to regain the trust of the black community.<br/><br/>It is very important that everyone understands that this rally is meant to be peaceful. <br/>Additionally, as we walk to the police department we must stay on the sidewalks and abide by traffic laws to ensure everyone stays safe. Please wear a mask, gloves, and  maintain social distancing per Gov Brown's orders. ",

The state exercised its authority\u2014for the first time ever\u2014to require federal dam operators to keep the Columbia and Snake rivers cool enough for salmon survival. And earlier this week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a plan to control water temperature in the Columbia and Lower Snake rivers. <br/><br/>The EPA's plan to reduce water temperature (called a Total Maximum Daily Load or TMDL) to protect salmon in the Columbia and Lower Snake rivers. The plan shows (once again!) that the dams create large, shallow reservoirs that trap the sun\u2019s heat and make the rivers too warm for salmon.  The TMDL provides strong evidence that the Lower Snake River dams must come down in order to save salmon and orcas, but we need to keep fighting to make sure the plan actually results in cooler water for salmon and steelhead.<br/><br/>The EPA will begin a 60-day public process on May 21, 2020. Comments should be provided to ColumbiaRiverTMDL@epa.gov by 5:00 pm Pacific time on July 21, 2020. ",

We\u2019ll practice the reality of trying to filter out the bird singing nearby in order to hear the one far away.  And we\u2019ll talk about why birds make sounds and what we can learn from listening to them.<br/><br/>Appropriate for anyone who is new to BBE or wants to learn more. ",

We cannot ensure security for the resistance community nor provide needed accessibility in this context without harming others. More info will be shared soon about next steps, including many ways to take action.<br/><br/>We stand in solidarity in with Black Lives Matter and against the police state. We see the expansion of ICE Detention prisons in the past 15 years as an aspect of the expansion of mass incarceration, authoritarianism, and the police state. Now is the time for creative collective action, centering De-Funding and abolishing Police and ICE, protecting Black Lives, and building Solidarity across movements. More coming soon!<br/>Call to Action!<br/><br/>Under Trump, ICE has become the American Gestapo, operating outside of local and international laws: imprisoning refugees in concentration camps, putting children in cages, hunting down our neighbors, and committing crimes against humanity.<br/><br/>ICE is a danger to our community, not just to those they target, to all of us. This is an organization that carries out raids and kidnappings in our \"sanctuary city\" with impunity, despite being embroiled in countless scandals. From abuse and sexual assaults on immigrants, to secret white nationalist facebook groups. From a culture of open cruelty and racism, to open neglect and even murder. Even their recent public shooting during an arrest in New York demonstrates just how reckless and dangerous they continue to be to the public at large.<br/><br/>In spite of this, our leaders continue to fail to protect our communities.<br/>In Washington County, the Sheriff just announced they would cooperate with ICE despite their a \"sanctuary\" status. In Multnomah County, ICE is deporting a Portland teacher and the mayor/police commissioner has been silent. Once again, it is on us, the people, to protect our community and defend our neighbors.<br/><br/>Again and again, we have seen injustice committed by our own government and have been unable to do anything about it, but this time, we can. <br/><br/>ICE is coming for one of our neighbors, someone who grew up in this community, in this city. Someone who worked hard to make something of himself so that he could give back to this community, as a teacher. His name is Hector, he is a 3rd grade teacher in the Montavilla neighborhood. He is also a father to a child that would remain in Portland. <br/><br/>Hector is a vital part of this community. Portland will fight for him like we mean it, because we do.<br/><br/>Our brother and comrade Hector faces deportation, we cannot and stay silent. <br/>We take this opportunity to demand ICE out of Oregon! <br/>We take this moment to demand an end to the deportations! <br/>We stand together to demand the abolition of ICE and the end of child and family separation! <br/><br/>Until the last cage is ripped open and the last child is set free, WE WILL FIGHT.<br/><br/>Join us!<br/><br/>This event is co-sponsored by Direct Action Alliance &amp; The Buddhist Peace Fellowship<br/>Organizations Standing in Solidarity:<br/>Portland Association of Teachers Racial and Social Justice Committees<br/>First Unitarian Church<br/>Teressa Raiford for Mayor 2020<br/>Portland Association of Teachers<br/>Bridger Equity Committee<br/>Jobs with Justice<br/>SURJ Black Lives Matter Action Group<br/>Innovation Law Lab<br/>Hampton Institute Working Class Think Tank<br/>World Arts Foundation, Inc.<br/><br/><br/>#keepHectorhome<br/> #AbolishICE<br/>#stopthedeportations<br/>#returnthechildren<br/>#endmassincarceration<br/><br/>ICE has become an extrajudicial organization that has been terrorizing immigrant communities across this country since it's creation, tearing families apart, disregarding local laws, and destroying public trust in vital institutions.

Thanks for your flexibility!<br/><br/>********<br/>Crows are everywhere: they are found on nearly every continent and thrive in human dominated environments. They have influenced art and literature throughout history, and whether they inspire love or hate, they have certainly impacted the hearts and minds of the humans who share their space. Because crows are so common, it may be easy to overlook the fact that they are very intelligent and have complex behaviors and social structures, including play, tool use, communal roosting, and being able to recognize specific humans.<br/><br/>Kaeli Swift, PhD, studies crows and other corvids (ravens, jays, and magpies), and will introduce and explain to us the world of these fascinating birds, including, of course, crow funerals. You can find Dr. Swift on Twitter and Instagram @corvidresearch where she talks about crows, corvids, and other wildlife and plays a weekly game called #CrowOrNo to help people learn how to correctly ID and distinguish different kinds of corvids.<br/><br/>Note: This is a repeat of several sold-out shows on this topic, and this one could sell out too.
