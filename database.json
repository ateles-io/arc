PM us to discuss size and payment.<br/>2.\tIf you cannot purchase a shirt, wear a plain black shirt and plain black pants to the best of your ability.<br/>3.\tSome signs will be provided.

Thanks for your flexibility!<br/><br/>********<br/>Crows are everywhere: they are found on nearly every continent and thrive in human dominated environments. They have influenced art and literature throughout history, and whether they inspire love or hate, they have certainly impacted the hearts and minds of the humans who share their space. Because crows are so common, it may be easy to overlook the fact that they are very intelligent and have complex behaviors and social structures, including play, tool use, communal roosting, and being able to recognize specific humans.<br/><br/>Kaeli Swift, PhD, studies crows and other corvids (ravens, jays, and magpies), and will introduce and explain to us the world of these fascinating birds, including, of course, crow funerals. You can find Dr. Swift on Twitter and Instagram @corvidresearch where she talks about crows, corvids, and other wildlife and plays a weekly game called #CrowOrNo to help people learn how to correctly ID and distinguish different kinds of corvids.<br/><br/>Note: This is a repeat of several sold-out shows on this topic, and this one could sell out too.

Southern Resident orcas are on the brink of extinction, partly because they cannot find enough Chinook salmon to eat. Despite these declines, salmon biologists also view the Snake River basin as among the best Chinook salmon restoration opportunities anywhere on the West Coast. Rather than taking steps to reduce the dams\u2019 temperature pollution, the Trump administration\u2019s Army Corps appealed the temperature limits imposed by Washington regulators to the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board.<br/><br/>We must put pressure on our elected officials to restore cold, clean water that supports strong salmon and orca populations for generations to come. But recovering salmon and orcas requires action in Congress, too. Tell Senators Murray and Cantwell, and the EPA, to develop a regional solution\u2014including Lower Snake River dam removal\u2014that protects salmon, Southern Resident orcas, and our communities.<br/><br/>Office of Senator Patty Murray <br/>https://www.murray.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contactme<br/><br/>Office Of Senator Maria Cantwell (Washington)<br/>https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/contact/email/form<br/><br/>Please take action today and tell Northwest elected leaders to develop inclusive solutions to keep the rivers cool, protect salmon, and reinvest in river communities. <br/><br/>** Sample letter ** <br/><br/>\"I'm writing to ask for your leadership to reduce water temperatures in the Snake and Columbia River to protect and restore endangered salmon, the Southern Resident orcas, and the communities who depend on them.<br/><br/>Specifically, I request that you consider the following points:<br/>* The Lower Snake and Columbia rivers are too hot for endangered salmon and steelhead. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study recently released by EPA clearly shows that the dams are the main cause of increased water temperatures.<br/><br/>* Large, shallow reservoirs created by the dams\u2014coupled with intensifying climate change\u2014threaten the Columbia and Snake rivers\u2019 already-imperiled salmon and steelhead.<br/><br/>* The science is clear\u2014restoring the Lower Snake River is our very best opportunity to restore imperiled salmon and orca populations.<br/><br/>* I urge you to work with the people and policymakers in the Northwest to develop a comprehensive package of measures that restores the Lower Snake River and its salmon, helps feed starving Southern Resident orca, and invests in clean energy that protects the health of our communities and our river.<br/><br/>*Northwest communities and leaders must work together to craft a bold and effective plan that achieves these goals as quickly as possible. Without effective leadership, we risk losing these iconic species and the special benefits they bring to our region. <br/><br/>Thank you again for your careful consideration of this request.\"<br/>",

            "description": "Join us for a virtual screening of the award-winning feature documentary \"The Beaver Believers\" hosted by filmmaker Sarah Koenigsberg, to benefit \"Speak for Wolves.\"  Q&amp;A to follow.  <br/><br/>Sometimes the best solutions to the biggest problems can be found in the most unexpected places. Meet the beaver believers: five scientists and a sassy, spicy hairdresser, taking a bite out of climate change, one stick at a time.<br/><br/>The Beaver Believers is the urgent yet whimsical story of an unlikely cadre of activists who share a common vision: restoring the North American Beaver, that most industrious, ingenious, bucktoothed engineer, to the watersheds of the arid West. The Beaver Believers encourage us to embrace a new paradigm for managing our western lands, one that seeks to partner with the natural world rather than overpower it. As a keystone species, beaver enrich their ecosystems, creating the complexity and resiliency our watersheds need to absorb the impacts of climate change. Beavers can show us the way and even do much of the work for us, if only we can find the humility to trust in the restorative power of nature and our own ability to play a positive role within it. <br/><br/>A favorite on the 2019 Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour, winner of the Green Spark Award at the American Conservation Film Festival, winner of the Eco-Hero Award at the Portland Eco-Film Festival, and a finalist at both the London Eco-Film Festival and the Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival, this film will inspire you to think differently about climate change.<br/><br/>Proceeds go to Speak for Wolves. Speak for Wolves is a small, volunteer-run 501(c)3 nonprofit organization advocating for wolf and wildlife conservation. Their primary activity is to gather wildlife conservation experts together each year for an educational conference that is free to attendees, with a goal to inspire and engage grassroots activists to advocate for wildlife management reform in the U.S.  www.speakforwolves.org<br/>",

In the time it takes you to stand up and kick the mud off of your boots, you\u2019re suddenly transported to the spacious pastures of our New York Sanctuary, where you find yourself surrounded by curious goats and friendly sheep eager for your attention.<br/><br/>This doesn\u2019t have to be a daydream.<br/><br/>Formerly known as the \u201cHoedown,\u201d Sanctuary Weekend is a beloved annual event typically held at our flagship New York Sanctuary. This year, for everyone\u2019s safety, we won\u2019t be convening in person\u2014but that won\u2019t hold us back from coming together as a community. And it gives us the opportunity to visit both Sanctuaries.<br/><br/>As always, our rescued residents remain the heart of Sanctuary Weekend. Our lifesaving work\u2014and the healing space that you help us provide\u2014are essential, especially now. Our knowledgeable shelter team will share recaps of this year\u2019s notable rescues, and take you around each Sanctuary to meet the animals.<br/><br/>We\u2019ll also be creating space for the big ideas you\u2019ve come to expect at Sanctuary Weekend, with a special panel discussion on community building featuring guest speakers. Plus, our leadership team will detail our mission and the work we\u2019re doing to create Sanctuary for all.<br/><br/>We hope you\u2019ll join us August 22-23 for an inspiring weekend rooted in compassion.",

Before they enter this facility and have their lives needlessly taken from them, some of these individuals experience - for the first time in their lives - a brief moment of compassion from activists who stop the trucks to bear witness to these unseen victims. On June 19th, 2020, a mere two days after ag-gag Bill 156 was passed through the Ontario Legislature, one of these activists - fierce animal rights champion Regan Russell - was violently run over and killed by a truck transporting pigs to Fearmans. The driver of the truck - who appears to have been emboldened by the passing of Bill 156 - has escaped criminal charges, and the Halton Police did not release the name of the truck driver, or the video of the incident.<br/> <br/>* * *<br/><br/>WHEN: On Saturday September 19 - on the 3 month anniversary of her tragic death - let us honor Regan\u2019s life as well as the lives of the 10,000 pigs who are are killed each day at Fearmans slaughterhouse.<br/><br/>* * *<br/> <br/>WHERE:  Everywhere!<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>HOW: Together, we will collectively run, walk, and bike 10,000 kms or more. <br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>WHO: Everyone is encouraged to participate in any capacity and distance in their respective cities. **Please mark yourselves as \"GOING\" if you plan to participate and click on the link at the top of the page to let us know how many kms you plan to run/walk/bike.

I am a husband, father, mason, and running enthusiast. I recently completed my goal of running every single street in Barrie, ON to raise awareness about veganism and the benefits of an animal-free diet and lifestyle. I have participated in several road races, obstacle races, duathlons, as well as fundraising events such as The Ride To Conquer Cancer. My longest running distance to date is a Marathon, and on September 19, 2020, my goal is to surpass that distance by running 50 kms to honor Regan\u2019s memory. I hope that others from across the globe will join me in achieving a collective 10,000 kms (or more!) to honor Regan as well as the 10,000 pigs who are senselessly slaughtered each day at Fearmans.<br/><br/>Follow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/run4regan?igshid=1sbq1zrf1w03a<br/><br/>#Run4Regan #JusticeForReganRussell #GoVegan4Regan #SavePigs4Regan #StopBill156 #RepealBill156<br/><br/>Demand a Coroner\u2019s Inquest: https://www.change.org/p/regional-supervising-coroner-demand-a-coroner-s-inquest-in-the-death-of-activist-regan-russell?recruiter=65282734&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=petition_dashboard&amp;recruited_by_id=92b5c723-cb17-4d31-b563-f75554925307&amp;utm_content=fht-23450758-en-ca%3A3<br/><br/>Petition - Stop Bill 156: https://www.change.org/p/doug-ford-stop-bill-156-ontario-s-ag-gag-law?fbclid=IwAR1_2bNHpyxvKXomJmL3siOFNNTOwGEnj5qsNJYqRPQajfCbHkHokec3R3w<br/><br/>Petition - Repeal Ag Gag Laws &amp; Protect Farmed Animals: https://e-activist.com/page/63205/petition/1?ea.tracking.id=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR1qSMVKToOpAnsrIvW6vakPpdxPX2NvHwnR8ZC5NY6BREySaMfbSD1JMvI<br/><br/>",

Those who strongly identify with white nationalist ideology view the consumption of animal bodies as an act of solidarity. At the end of the day, the question for me is not, \u201cWhy is animal exploitation a matter of white national identity?\u201d To the animals who exist as mere products in the food chain, it doesn\u2019t matter. For me, the question is, \u201cWhy do more people not forego animal exploitation as a matter of political resistance?\"<br/><br/>Register here to join this fascinating discussion: <br/>https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0ocOqgpj0pH9CL-S-GVTneIeyMkVVxbTUR <br/><br/>Event takes place on Sunday, September 27th at 10am PDT.<br/><br/>To learn more about Christopher Sebastian's work, please see <br/>https://www.christophersebastian.info/lectures",

The menu features seasonal produce sourced from local farms. Ingredients are organic whenever possible. We will be donating 15% of ticket sales to Black Futures Farm, a local community farm that is part of the Black Food Sovereignty Coalition program.<br/><br/>TICKETS: tinyurl.com/veganizer-desipdx<br/><br/>Your $65 ticket includes the following menu. It's a feast for one person, enough for two people. This event is takeout only. Select your preferred time slot for pickup at DesiPDX (4233 N Mississippi Ave); we offer 15-minute windows between 5pm and 8pm. Spots are limited, so we can accommodate social distancing. Please wear a mask.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>MENU<br/>100% vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, nut-free<br/><br/>Seasonal Greens, Roasted and Pickled Seasonal Veggies, Charred Peach Chutney Dressing<br/><br/>Desi \"Ratatouille\" - Eggplant, Zucchini, and Tomato Curry<br/><br/>Grilled Mushrooms, Twice Cooked Potatoes, Coconut Milk Tandoori Sauce<br/><br/>Black Lentils, Kale, Coconut Ghee Beets<br/><br/>Basmati Rice, Lovage, Fennel<br/><br/>Coconut Milk, Turmeric, and Black Pepper Fudge<br/><br/>Menu subject to change based on availability of ingredients<br/><br/>TICKETS: tinyurl.com/veganizer-desipdx<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>DESIPDX<br/>DesiPDX is a food cart located on Portland\u2019s bustling N. Mississippi Avenue serving food inspired by Indian spices and flavors that are blended with cooking styles from the West and other parts of the world, bringing a modern take to classic Indian recipes. The name of the cart is a play on the word Desi as the food uses locally and regionally sourced organic ingredients and expands on the idea of what \u201cauthentic\u201d Indian food can be in a globalized world.<br/><br/>CHEF DEEPAK SAXENA was raised on traditional Indian food by his mother and father and found his own love for cooking in his early 20\u2019s. In 2015, after 20 years as a software developer he decided to follow his 10 year dream of turning his love for food into his livelihood and opened DesiPDX in 2015. His prior career provided him many opportunities to travel the world and experience a variety of cooking styles and flavors.<br/><br/>Eric Schlosser\u2019s seminal work, Fast Food Nation, set him on a course of changing his eating habits and also cooking more sustainably. This path also inspired him to be an advocate for healthy living and eating, and become involved in food policy and food politics. At DesiPDX, you will find these healthy and sustainable ideals literally cooked into the delicious fare.<br/><br/>DesiPDX is in ever evolving exploration in Indian Fusion fare incorporating traditional roots, many international influences, and Deepak\u2019s own culinary whims. You will always discover new experiments on the menu whether it\u2019s the weekly dhal, a seasonal garnish, or unique ingredients, spices, or flavor combinations. Deepak is committed to making sure everyone can indulge at DesiPDX with a Gluten-Free and Paleo/Vegan-Friendly menu and an intention to source locally and organically as much as possible.<br/><br/>His ingredient selections for organic and local are based on research on health, sustainability, and risk as well as cost.<br/><br/>VEGANIZER<br/>Veganizer is a food consulting agency that collaborates with omnivore restaurants to host #officiallyveganized events and expand their vegan offerings, while bridging the gap between omnivore establishment and the vegan customer. Led by vegan blogger Waz Wu, the Portland chapter has quickly gained momentum since its launch in early 2017 and partnered with MF Tasty, Doug Fir Lounge, Red Sauce Pizza, Quaintrelle, Gumba, and many more. Veganizer PDX has been featured on KGW News, Eater PDX, Willamette Week, and local podcasts.<br/>",
